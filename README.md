# HR-Annalytics-Project-Using-Power-BI
I have created a POWER BI DASHBOARD for HR ANNALYTICS          

OBJECTIVE:
The HR of a company wants us to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze the Attrition Rate depending on different factors of the company. 

This project involves following steps:
Data collection, Data cleaning and wrangling, Data modeling, Data visualization, Data- Dashboard designing. (Using Power BI)

INSIGHTS:
•	Key performance indicators (KPIs) used to understand the different factors about the employees like total employee, attrition count, attrition rate, average salary, average age, and average years spend in the present company
•	The male and female count is also very important in this case to understand the attrition rate between the genders
•	We can see the life science and medical background people are the one who have the most attrition rate among all the educational back ground and this need to be investigated by the company.
•	Laboratory technician, sales executive, research scientists are the job roles which are leaving the company most amongst all the job roles.
•	Level of job satisfaction is a key issue in case of attrition and the company should make sure of the satisfaction of their employee.
•	The most hike in the attrition has been seen in the following cases – in case of lower job level, age between 26 to 35, salary only up to 5k and in the 1st and 2nd year of job.


PROJECT LEARNINGS:
•	Import and transform the data in Power BI and created new measures using DAX equation
•	Created interactive dashboard to understand the nature of attrition in the company
•	Used filter and slicers to see the data in an interactive and more productive way
•	Used different types of customized visualizations (bar chart, donut chart, area chart, waterfall chart, tables, cards, slicers, etc.)
